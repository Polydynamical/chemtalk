# ChemTalk

A simple program to output a given phrase using elemental symbols. Note: this does not work all the time since there are certain combinations of letters that are not found in abbreviations of chemical elements. For example, "Ad" in "Adamantane" is not possible. Therefore, you will sometimes see parantheses around letters that just have to be taken as is.
